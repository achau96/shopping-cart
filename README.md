What Did I learn?

1. Routing with React basics. This is very beneficial and efficient compared to
   when I created "routing" with basic javascript in the restaurant-menu project.

2. Use render instead of component to pass props over like normal with
   react-router-dom.

Things to Impove On

1. More organizing. Very messy folders. :P
2. I feel there were places I could reduce a lot of code by using mapping, filtering, etc. However, the project was small so not needed.
3. Could also add the ability to add to cart in the checkout section instead of just the shop section.
4. Could fix the styling a bit.
